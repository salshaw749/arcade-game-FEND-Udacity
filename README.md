## Instructions

To start the game, use your keys (left, right, up, down) to move the player. Avoid bugs to make it to the lake and win the game. If you get hit by a bug you'll have to start over. Once the player won a alert will pop up. Also, the enemies(bugs) move in varying speeds and once the player collides with an enemy, a alert will pop up and the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
